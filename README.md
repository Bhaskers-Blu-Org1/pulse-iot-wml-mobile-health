## MyPulse - IoT WML Mobile Health App

The idea behind this application is to have a way to check pulse rates with the most available devices and these are the mobile phones.

A brief description:

- Create a classification Model using a dataset which contains the pulse data and its related derived values. Deploy the Model and expose it as WML endpoints
- Register the Mobile device with Watson IoT Platform
- Using the mobile app, generate the LIVE pulse data. This data is published to IoT platform and then stored in a NoSQL database
- Streaming the pulse data from the app in real-time (or the database) and using WML validate it with the deployed model

## TUTORIAL STEPS

- Steps 1 & 5 - [Node.js application](https://github.com/hovig/pulse-iot-wml-mobile-health/blob/master/NodejsApplication.md)
- Step 2 - [Watson Machine Learning](https://github.com/hovig/pulse-iot-wml-mobile-health/blob/master/WatsonMachineLearning.md)
- Step 3 - [Watson IoT Platform](https://github.com/hovig/pulse-iot-wml-mobile-health/blob/master/WatsonIoTPlatform.md)
- Step 4 - [IBM Studios](https://github.com/hovig/pulse-iot-wml-mobile-health/blob/master/IBMStudios.md)


<hr>

- After doing the above <u>**tutorial steps.**</u>
- Try it on your mobile phone's browser: `http://<YOUR_APP_NAME>.mybluemix.net`

  >You can try my running app [http://mypulse.mybluemix.net/](http://mypulse.mybluemix.net/) to have a feel how it looks like, but mine exceeded the allowance plan for the machine learning service so the prediction parts will be displayed with <b>"undefined"</b>

- Open [Watson IoT Platform Quickstart](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/)
- Put your device id on there for real-time streaming view of your data.
