# MyPulse - An IoT Waton Machine Learning Mobile Health App

The idea behind this application is to have a way to check pulse rates with the most available devices, mobile phones. Here's a brief description of the code pattern:

* Create a classification model using a dataset which contains the pulse data and its related derived values. Deploy the model and expose it as Watson Machine Learning endpoints
* Register the mobile device with Watson IoT Platform
* Using the mobile app, generate the LIVE pulse data. This data is published to IoT platform and then stored in a NoSQL database
* Streaming the pulse data from the app in real-time (or the database) and using Watson Machine Learning validate it with the deployed model

## Steps

* Steps 1 & 5 - [Node.js application](https://github.com/hovig/pulse-iot-wml-mobile-health/blob/master/NodejsApplication.md)
* Step 2 - [Watson Machine Learning](https://github.com/hovig/pulse-iot-wml-mobile-health/blob/master/WatsonMachineLearning.md)
* Step 3 - [Watson IoT Platform](https://github.com/hovig/pulse-iot-wml-mobile-health/blob/master/WatsonIoTPlatform.md)
* Step 4 - [IBM Studios](https://github.com/hovig/pulse-iot-wml-mobile-health/blob/master/IBMStudios.md)

## Sample output

* After doing the above steps, try it on your mobile phone's browser: `http://<YOUR_APP_NAME>.mybluemix.net`

  You can try our demo app at [http://mypulse.mybluemix.net/](http://mypulse.mybluemix.net/) to have an idea how it looks. Note that if the machine learning service is over quota is will show `undefined` for some fields.

* Open [Watson IoT Platform Quickstart](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/)
* Put your device id on there for real-time streaming view of your data.
